# Data Profiles

## Why? 
These profiles are the statisitcal interpretation of sampled production data.
They are to be used for profile analysis.

## How are they sampled?
Record sets of <= 1000 records are profiled in full.
Record sets of > 1000 records are sampled at 10%.
Sample candidates are selected using Bernoulli sampling.
